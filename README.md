# Fun with GPU Particles

This is a project I made for a course in advanced game programming at Link√∂ping University during the autumn of 2018.

A particle system running on the GPU was implemented to simulate 400 000 snow flakes falling down the sky of a mountain scene. As the particles collide with the terrain, snow start to build up. This causes the scene to transform from the gray color of the mountain to a snow covered white scene.
