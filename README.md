# Fun with GPU Particles

This is a project I made for a course in advanced computer graphics at Link√∂ping University.

The aim of the project is to simulate particles on the GPU that interact with objects in the scene.
 
My inspiration for the project was the snow from Battlefield V that follows the contour of objects it collides with. I was very impressed by that when I first saw it and wanted to have a go at it myself.
